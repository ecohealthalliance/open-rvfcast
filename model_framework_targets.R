## Some settings that change much about the pipeline ---------------------------

## Whether to use H3 hex-based spatial aggregation (TRUE) or ADM2 regions (FALSE)
 ## NOTE: Has to match what was used in the previous phase of the pipeline
 ## (rvf_data_processing_targets.R) because the data output from that phase will have
 ## region names that must be matched here. For example, if TRUE in the previous pipeline
 ## which_countries -> region_districts will be an empty list (as there are no country
 ## names in the hex ids)
using_hexes     <- TRUE

## Column name that refers to the subregions. Default if not manually adjusted in
 ## the previous pipeline (rvf_data_processing_targets.R) is "shapeName"
 ## NOTE: code was originally built for using_hexes == FALSE (hex option added later)
 ## so some code was added here and there to add using_hexes == FALSE language to the
 ## object created with using_hexes == TRUE.
 ## The short of it is shapeName is fine for now regardless of the above choice,
 ## however leaving this here for flexibility in case some input layers change. Easier to
 ## adjust here than everywhere in the code
